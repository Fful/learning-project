"Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition" language:ru

this is my rep for learning some basic staff about pandas/numpay/some graph-libs

There are learning files where i test some interesting features 
and notebooks for data analisys, statistic and ML:

Titanic.ipynb is about titanic survivers (first interaction with sci-learn lib).
UsaGovData.ipynb using USA.gov data to detect os of users.
MovieLens.ipynb is dataset cleaning up and generating by the Shyong Lam and Jon Herlocker, used by me to find sms old movies which I somehow missed.
